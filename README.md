# hello-world
Just to show I've done this reading based tutorial.
I've been on GitHub for over a year, but I deleted my account at one point.
Then I deleted it again after setting it up a second time. 
I did it so I could assist others with setting up their GitHub accounts.
You see, not everyone learns by reading. Some learn by doing.
